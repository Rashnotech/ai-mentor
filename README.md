# ai-mentor
The platform delivers hands-on, project-based learning with a built-in coding workspace, file submission system, and an AI mentor that provides real-time debugging, project reviews, and personalized learning paths. Target users: beginners to intermediate learners wanting practical, portfolio-ready skills.


AI Mentor Personalization Engine - Architecture Spec1. Executive SummaryThe Personalization Engine is an event-driven system designed to move beyond static learning paths. By analyzing micro-behaviors (typing cadence, error frequency, documentation usage) during a 10-minute onboarding window, we construct a psychometric profile of the developer. This profile drives a dynamic curriculum generation engine powered by LLMs.2. Data Flow ArchitectureTelemetry Collector (Frontend SDK): A lightweight JS wrapper around the code editor. It listens for keystrokes, Run button clicks, and tab switches (focus events).Signal Aggregator (FastAPI): Buffers these events and calculates derived metrics (WPM, Error Rate) every 30 seconds.Heuristic Classifier: Deterministic logic (Python) that maps metrics to an Archetype (e.g., "Prompt-Heavy Learner").Curriculum Orchestrator: Combines the Archetype + User Goal into a complex prompt context.LLM Layer: Generates the JSON blueprint.3. Behavioral Signal Processing (The "First 10 Minutes")We do not ask the user "Are you fast?"; we watch them run.SignalDefinitionInsight DerivedKeystroke LatencyAvg time between keystrokes.Proficiency. erratic latency = searching keys (novice); smooth = muscle memory (pro).Run-to-Edit RatioHow often they hit "Run" vs. typing code.Style. High ratio = Trial & Error (hacker); Low ratio = Planner (architect).Error DeltaDoes the error message change between runs?Problem Solving. Same error 5x = Stuck/Frustrated; Changing errors = Progressing.Focus LossSwitching tabs/windows.Resourcefulness. Switching tabs usually means reading docs or StackOverflow (Independent).Hint LatencyTime before asking AI for help.Resilience. <30s = Low resilience (Prompt-heavy); >5m = High resilience.4. The Profiling Matrix (Archetypes)The engine classifies users into one of 6 quadrants. This directly impacts the UI/UX.A. The "Project-First Learner"Signals: Jumps straight to code editor, low reading time, high trial-and-error.UI Adaptation: Hide the "Theory" sidebar by default. Show the terminal full screen.Mentor Persona: "Pair Programmer." Less talk, more code snippets.B. The "Instruction-First Learner"Signals: Spends 5+ minutes reading instructions before typing a single character.UI Adaptation: Split screen 50/50 (Code/Text). Highlight key concepts in bold.Mentor Persona: "Professor." Explains the Why before the How.C. The "Fast but Error-Prone" (The Cowboy)Signals: 80+ WPM, Syntax errors every run, rarely reads error logs.UI Adaptation: Intrusive Linter. Block the "Run" button until syntax is valid.Mentor Persona: "Senior Code Reviewer." Point out edge cases and sloppy variable names.5. Goal-Based Path MappingThe UserGoal Enum dictates the "Macro-Structure" of the path, while the Archetype dictates the "Micro-Structure."Scenario: "Build a Startup MVP" (Goal) + "Project-First" (Archetype)Skip: Big O Notation, Sorting Algorithms, Low-level Memory Management.Focus: FastAPI, Stripe API, JWT Auth, Docker, React Integration.Scaffolding: Low. Give them a blank file and a requirement. "Build an endpoint that returns JSON."Pacing: Aggressive.Scenario: "Get a Job" (Goal) + "Instruction-First" (Archetype)Include: Algorithm optimization, System Design, Unit Testing (Pytest).Focus: Code readability, PEP8 standards, Documentation.Scaffolding: High. "Fill in the missing lines to optimize this loop."Pacing: Moderate, ensuring comprehension.6. Database Schema StrategyWe need a hybrid approach.PostgreSQL (Relational):users (id, email, current_level)curriculums (id, user_id, current_module_index, total_modules)modules (content, quizzes, projects)MongoDB / TimescaleDB (Telemetry):session_logs (user_id, timestamp, event_type, payload)Used for re-evaluating the user if their style changes over time.7. LLM Prompt StrategyWe utilize Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for the curriculum generation.Context Injection: Feed the behavioral analysis JSON.Constraint Setting: "You are designing for a user who builds startups. Do not teach Bubble Sort. Teach them how to query a database efficiently."Format Enforcement: "Output must be valid JSON matching the PersonalizedPath schema."
